BingusNametags++ is a simple, clean, but customizable nametag mod for Gorilla Tag. You can customize it to your needs with a very cool featureset:

- customize your own nametag with **bold** *italicized*, underlined, and colored text
- customize the font used by pasting a `.ttf` or `.otf` file into the data directory
- change visibility of certain items (such as platform/special user icons and the nametags themselves)
- change offset, scale, and visibility of nametags
- change where the nametag is visible (for example, show in VR but not on the PC monitor)

It's also open-source, free, and doesn't take up half of your screen.
